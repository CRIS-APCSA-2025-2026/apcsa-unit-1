# APCSA Topic 1.3 - Expressions and Output

## Essential Knowledge

**Learning Objective 1.3.A**  
Write *statements* to produce output. Analyze the code to determine the results that would be displayed.  

**Essential Knowledge 1.3.A.1**  
`System.out.print` and `System.out.println` send character data to *standard output*, which is in this course, displays information to the user in a terminal.  
`System.out.println` appends a *newline character*, which moves the cursor to a new line in the terminal. `System.out.print` does not append a newline.

**Learning Objective 1.3.B**  
Write code using *string literals* and understand the results.  

**Essential Knowledge 1.3.B.1**  
A *literal* is a fixed value written directly in code. The value is not evaluated or simplified: **It is what it is**.  

**Essential Knowledge 1.3.B.2**  
A *string literal* is a sequence of characters contained in double quotes.  

ðŸ•® See *Think Java 2*, Section 1.5 (page 6)

**Essential Knowledge 1.3.B.3**  
*Escape sequences* start with a `\` followed by another character, which together, have a special meaning

Escape sequences used in this course:
* `\"` â†’ double quote  
* `\\` â†’ backslash  
* `\n` â†’ new line
